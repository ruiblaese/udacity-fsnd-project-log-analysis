## Intro

In the next part of this course, you'll use a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server and a web app that uses it. The VM is a Linux server system that runs on top of your own computer. You can share files easily between your computer and the VM; and you'll be running a web service inside the VM which you'll be able to access from your regular browser.

## Installation

- Install VirtualBox, instructions for VirtualBox [here](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)

## Instructions
